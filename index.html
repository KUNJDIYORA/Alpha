    <ul><p> Krishna was born on the 18th (Ashtami) day of the dark fortnight within the Bhadrapada month (August – September) in Mathura. He was Devaki and Vasudeva's son. When Krishna was born, Mathura was ruled by his uncle King Kansa, who wanted to kill his family's children as a vaticination said that the couple's eighth son would beget Kansa's downfall.

    <ul class="life" > Life Story of Lord Krishna</ul>


    <ul class="one">Lord Krishna is one of the incarnations of Lord Vishnu. He was born about 5200 years ago on the 8th day of the dark fortnight in the Bhadon month of the Hindu calendar. He is considered as an extremely powerful god. He was born on the Earth with a special purpose of freeing it from the evil clasps. He had a profound influence in the epic, Mahabharata, where he took Pandavas's side and guided them to victory in the battle of Kurukshetra. Throughout his life, he preached the concept of Bhakti and Karma. </ul>
    <ul class="one">Lord Krishna was born in jail since his parents were kept in prison by his uncle Kansha. Kansha feared that the eighth child of their parents would kill him. Although Krishna was the eighth child, his father Vasudev saved him from Kansha by giving him his friend Nand. Krishna grew up in the Gokul society by his foster father, Nand, and foster mother, Yashoda. He showed several magical performances by killing several asuras throughout his childhood and youth, and he grew up to be a strong person. Finally, he and his brother Balaram went to Kansas’s palace for a fighting tournament, where Krishna killed Kansha. </ul>
    <ul class="one">Several shows on Lord Krishna broadcast on television on a daily basis. I loved to watch them when I was a child, and also now. I love the fact that Krishna loves to eat Makhan, which he used to steal from his mother's kitchen. For this reason, Lord Krishna is also known as 'Natkhat Nand Lal.' He was called Natkhat because he was very naughty when he was a child. He played with friends and cows, and therefore, he is also called Govind. </ul>
    <ul class="one">Lord Krishna was dark-skinned, as dark as rain-filled clouds. Lord Krishna's best friend is his aunt Radha. Radha is very important in the life of Lord Krishna. Lord Krishna loves to spend time with her. He also loves to spend time with other friends like Sudama.  </ul>

    <ul class="life">Importance of Janmashtami</ul>
     
    <ul class="one">Lord Krishna is considered the eighth icon of Lord Vishnu, the conserver among the Trinity. His birth is famed extensively as Krishna Janmashtami or Gokul Ashtami. Lord Krishna was born during a dungeon in present-day Mathura in Uttar Pradesh in the dark to Queen Devaki and King Vasudeva. Krishna is now described in Hindu epics as the god of affection, tender heartedness, and compassion. He's also praised as a prankster who frequently used his supreme powers to help others, stunning his musketeers and family. </ul>

    <ul class="life">Some rituals linked with celebration are as follows:</ul>

    <ul class="one">Jhulan Utsav and Ghatas are the two rudiments of the jubilee. Krishna followers hang swings in their houses during Jhulan Utsav and place God’s idol within.  </ul>
    <ul class="one">Numerous people observe a presto on Janmashtami. Those who are dieting aren't permitted to ingest grains, thus they follow the Falahar diet, which consists of just fruits and water. </ul>
    <ul class="one">Breaking the fast, or Parana, should be done at the correct time. When both Rohini Nakshatra and Ashtami Tithi are over, the fast is concluded. People visit tabernacles to seek blessings from Lord Krishna. On this auspicious day, followers organise plays and cotillion events grounded on Lord Krishna’s life and the famed tale of his birth is told at Hindu tabernacles. </ul>
    <ul class="one">  A religious mood pervades every place, particularly inside the tabernacles. Away from reciting mantras, there's also a form in which the 108 names of Lord Krishna are sung as flowers are poured on the Lord’s statue. </ul>


    <ul class="life">Conclusion</ul>

    <ul class="one">Janmashtami is also celebrated in houses in different ways. People decorate both the inside and outside of the house with lights. They perform pujas and offerings at different temples. On the eve of Janmashtami, we all hear the sound of mantras and bells for the entire day. Many people also love to sing and dance to religious songs. Janmashtami is considered as one of the most pompous and joyous festivals in Hinduism.</ul>
